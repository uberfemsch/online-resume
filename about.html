    <h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Hello there! ðŸ‘‹</h2> 

<p>
    I'm Nichole Campbell, and I'm on an exciting journey of self-discovery in the realm of full-stack development. I find immense joy in crafting digital landscapes through websites and applications. My passion for this field dates back to my teenage years, and after a brief detour into the world of sales, I've returned to my true loveâ€”coding.

Around 18 years ago, I took my first steps into the world of web development. Life led me down a different path for a while, but now, I'm fully committed to honing my skills and showcasing my projects right here.

What draws me to development is the ability to lose myself in the creative process for hours on end. The fusion of creativity with technology is where I thrive, and each project is a canvas for my ideas.

When I'm not immersed in code, my home is filled with the delightful chaos of two cats, Sam and Drax, and two dogs, Alis and Dagan. Among my many companions, my extensive collection of houseplants, with Anthuriums as my favorites, adds a touch of green to my space.

Learning is a constant companion in my life. I have a keen interest in psychology and philosophy, seeking to understand the intricacies of the human mind and the profound questions that shape our existence.

Mark Twain has been a childhood hero of mine. His wit, inventiveness, and ability to find humor in everything resonate deeply with me. In the spirit of Twain, I approach both challenges and successes with a lighthearted perspective. I'm thrilled to share my coding adventures with you. Join me on this journey, and let's see where the world of full-stack development takes me!
